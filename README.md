# Psycho-Patrol-R-Save-Editor
Save editor for the game Psycho Patrol R


This Python program edits the Psycho Patrol R save file located in `%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\Psycho Patrol R`. The save editor has options to edit such as:

* Edit money
* Load/Backup your save file


More features will be added soon, once I understand how the save file works.
